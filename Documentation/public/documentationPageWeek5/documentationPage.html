        <h3> 1. Commonjs vs. type module in Node.js</h3>

        <p>
            CommonJS is the original module system used in Node.js. It uses require() to import modules and module.exports to export modules.
            CommonJS modules are loaded synchronously, which means that the module will be loaded and evaluated before the execution of the code continues.
            <br>
            ES modules, on the other hand, use the import statement to import modules and the export keyword to export modules.
            ES modules are loaded asynchronously, which means that the module is loaded and evaluated only when it is actually needed.
        </p>

        <h3> 2. What is XSS and how to prevent it</h3>

        <p>
            XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects malicious code
            into a web application, which is then executed by unsuspecting users who access the application. This can result in
            the attacker gaining access to sensitive information, stealing credentials, or performing other malicious actions on behalf
            of the user.
            <br>
            <br>
            XSS vulnerabilities can be introduced into a web application:
            <br>
            <br>
            a) Input fields - Malicious code can be injected into input fields such as search boxes, comment sections, and contact forms.
            <br>
            b) URL parameters - Attackers can append malicious code to URL parameters that are used to display dynamic content on a page.
            <br>
            c) Cookies - Malicious code can be injected into cookies, which are then sent to the server with every subsequent request.
            <br>
            d) Third-party scripts - Scripts provided by third-party sources such as advertisements, widgets, and plugins can also introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
            <br>
            <br>
            To sanitize user input and prevent XSS attacks, you can use an NPM package called <b>xss</b>.
            This package provides a set of functions that can be used to sanitize user input and prevent the execution of malicious code. 
            For example, you can specify which HTML tags and attributes are allowed, and which should be removed.
