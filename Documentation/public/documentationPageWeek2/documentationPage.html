        <h3> 1. Scoping</h3>
        <p>
            Scope determines the accessibility or visibility of variables to JavaScript.
            <br>
            a) Global scope
            <br>
            b) Local scope
            <br>
            Variables declared outside a function are in the global scope. Global variables can be accessed and changed in any other scope.
            Variables defined within a function are in local scope and are not accessible in other functions. Each function,
            when invoked, creates a new scope, therefore variables with the same name can be used in different functions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Use let when you know that the value of a variable will change.
            <br>
            Use const for every other variable.
            <br>
            Do not use var.
        </p>

        <h3> 2. Package.JSON</h3>
        <p>
            It is a JSON file that lives in the root directory of your project. It holds important information
            about the project. It contains human-readable metadata about the project as well as functional metadata like the
            package version number and a list of dependencies required by the application.

        <h3> 3. Create a server insntance with Express</h3>

        <p>
            Assume we already installed express and set up package.json. Then we go in our app.js and import express.
            After that we create a new instance of the Express framework. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Finaly we create a method that starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port.
        </p>

        <p>
            And in order to actually see something we can make a simple get request which will send a message as a responce.
        </p>
