        <h3> 1. SSR vs CSR</h3>

        <p>
            Server-Side Rendering and Client-Side Rendering are two approaches for rendering web pages.
        </p>
            <h3>a) SSR</h3>
        <p>
            Time: SSR can provide faster initial load times because the server sends a fully formed HTML response to the client, 
            which reduces the amount of time required for the browser to render the page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Resources spent: SSR can require more resources on the server side because it needs to render each page request.
            However, once the page is rendered, the client-side JavaScript can take over and provide interactivity without additional server requests.
            <br>
            <br>
            SEO: SSR can improve SEO because search engine crawlers can easily crawl and index the fully formed HTML response.
        </p>

        <h3>b) CSR</h3>
        <p>
            Time: CSR can provide faster subsequent page loads because the client-side JavaScript can take over and render subsequent
            pages without additional server requests.
            <br>
            <br>
            Resources spent: CSR can require more resources on the client side because the client needs to download and execute the
            JavaScript code required to render the page.
            <br>
            <br>
            SEO: CSR can potentially harm SEO because search engine crawlers may not be able to crawl and index the content
            rendered by client-side JavaScript.

        <h3> 2. How code affects application memory</h3>

        <p>
            The code of an application can affect its memory usage in various ways like:
            <br>
            <br>
            a) Data Structures - The way data is stored and accessed by an application can have a big impact on its memory usage.
            <br>
            b) Memory Allocation - The way memory is allocated and deallocated by an application can also have an impact on its
               memory usage. For example, if an application frequently allocates and deallocates memory for small objects, it can
               lead to memory fragmentation and increased memory usage.
            <br>
            c) Recursion - Recursive algorithms can cause an application to consume a large amount of memory if they are not implemented
               carefully. Each recursive call adds a new stack frame to the call stack, which can quickly consume memory if the recursion
               depth is high.
            <br>
            d) Garbage Collection: The way an application handles garbage collection can also impact its memory usage. If an application
               does not release memory promptly, it can lead to increased memory usage and potentially cause performance issues.
